  <p>Some countries require employers to purchase Employer’s Liability (EL) or Workers’ Compensation coverage to protect their legal liability for injury or disease sustained by their employees as a result of their employment.<br>
In select local markets, Generali GC&C offers tailored insurance solutions to address these needs. These may include pain and suffering, special damages including loss of income, disadvantage in the labor market, and compensation for dependents of work- ers who lose their lives on the job.<br>
Our in-house Risk Engineering experts can help improve business resilience and offer advice for tailoring risk management services, including Health & Safety risk assess- ments. As part of our Multinational Program offering, Excess Employers’ Liability cov- erage can be provided under the Global Master policy.

  <p>While Generali GC&C provides coverage for annual policies for construction compa- nies, we also insure Single Projects on a stand-alone basis (in excess of section II of CAR/EAR policies, or directly on a primary basis). Construction projects often include a large number of trades, subcontractors and suppliers. A cross liabilities clause guar- antees that the risk of injury to another contractor’s employees, or damage to another contractor’s property, be borne by the third party coverage.<br>
Damage to surrounding property also represents a signi cant exposure, for example where excavation work on a section of pavement damages underground services, or worksite excavation weakens support on a neighboring property. Consequential loss resulting from property damage should also be a major consideration, given that work in high-risk locations such as power plants or pipelines could lead to large  nancial losses resulting from property damage.
